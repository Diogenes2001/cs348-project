-- FEATURE 3: User signup / login with authentication and encrypted passwords

-- Example signup / adding new users
INSERT INTO "User"(username, email, "password")

-- Example login with authentication / verifying old password
SELECT "password"

-- FEATURE 4: User-owned pokemon

-- Example insertion

INSERT INTO OwnedPokemon (species, owner, nickname, level, ability, move1)
	SELECT id, 'user1', 'Dragon', 5, 'Blaze', 'Ember' FROM Pokemon
	WHERE name = 'Charmander';

-- Check the inserted tuple

SELECT * FROM OwnedPokemon WHERE ownedID=56;

-- Example modification

UPDATE OwnedPokemon SET species = (SELECT id FROM Pokemon WHERE name='Charmander'), 
	level = 3, hp = 15, def = 20
WHERE ownedID = 56;

-- Check the inserted tuple

SELECT * FROM OwnedPokemon WHERE ownedID=56;

-- Example deletion
